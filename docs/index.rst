Welcome to pyA2L's documentation!
=================================

pyA2L is a Python toolkit for working with ASAM MCD-2 MC (ASAP2) A2L files. The library parses A2L into a SQLite-backed model, provides inspection and validation utilities, and enables automation around ECU measurement and calibration metadata. For background on the ASAP2 standard, see: https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/mcd-2-mc/wiki/
